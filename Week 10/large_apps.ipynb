    "Thus far in this course material we have covered a large number of Python features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Introduction to Programming course introduced control structures, such as while and for, functions, and basic data structures, such as lists, tuples and dictionaries. In principle, those tools are all that is needed to express anything a programmer may wish to express with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this Advanced Course in Programming, beginning in part 8 of the material, you have become familiar with classes and objects. Let's take a moment to consider when and why they are necessary, if those basic tools from parts 1 to 7 should be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Managing complexity\n",
    "Objects and classes are by no means necessary in every programming context. For example, if you are programming a smallish script for one-time use, objects are usually surplus to requirement. However, when you are programming something larger and more complicated, objects become very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When programs grow in complexity, the amount of details quickly becomes unmanageable, unless the program is organised in some systematic way. Even some of the more complicated exercises on this course so far would have benefited from the examples set in this part of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fo decades the concept of separation of concerns has been one of the central principles in programming, and the larger field of computer science. Quoting from Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections such that each section addresses a separate concern. A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separating the program into sections, so that each has its own concern to handle, helps in managing the inevitable complexity of a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are one way of organising a program into distinct, manageable wholes. Instead of writing a single script, the idea is to formulate small, separately verifiable functions which each solve some part of the larger problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common approach to managing larger programs is objects, through object oriented programming principles. There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, and each programmer has their own favourite. As we have seen so far, objects and classes allow us to collect all the data and the code processing that data within a single unit, in the attributes and methods of an object. Furthermore, objects provide a way of encapsulating the data they control, so that other parts of the program do not have to worry about the internal details of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A worked example: phone book\n",
    "How should a program be divided into classes and objects? This is by no means an easy question with a single acceptable answer, so we will proceed with an example. In part five you completed a phone book application, and now we will implement something similar using object oriented programming principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the separation of concerns principle, a program should be divided into sections which each have their own cause to take care of. In object oriented programming this translates to the single-responsibility principle. Without going into the finer details, its fundamental purpose is clear from the name: a single class and objects created based on it should have a single responsibility in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is often used as a way of modelling real world objects and phenomena. A single object in the real world is modelled with a single class in program code. In the case of a phone book such objects might be\n",
    "\n",
    "* a person\n",
    "* a name\n",
    "* a phone number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A name and a phone number may be thought of as just bits of data which do not merit their own classes, but a person is a distinct physical entity in the real world, and in the programming world it could work as a class. A Person object would be responsible for tying together a name and the phone numbers attached to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A phone book itself could be a good candidate for a class. Its responsibility would be to manage different person objects and the data they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have outlined the core of our application: phone book and person constitute the programming logic of our application, or application logic in short. Our application would need some other classes, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "`It is usually a good idea to keep any interaction with a user separate from the application logic. It is, after all, a responsibility all on its own. In addition to the core application logic, our program should therefore contain a class which handles the user interface.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our phone book should have some means of persistent storage between executions. File handling is, again, a clearly separate responsibility, so it deserves a class of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an outline of the basic components of our program, the question arises: where should we begin programming? Again, there is no right or wrong answer, but it is often a good idea to start with some part of the application logic.\n",

    "# Some concluding remarks\n",
    "The structure of the PhoneBook example above follows the fundamental principles of object oriented programming rather well. The central tenet is to identify the different responsibilities in the program and divide these logically among the different classes and methods. One of the main motivations for this division is managing complexity. Another important motive is that a logical division of responsibilities - modularity, in professional terminology - often makes the code easier to maintain and expand upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the software packages being developed and used in the wider world, the overwhelmingly most expensive facet of development is maintenance and expansion, meaning debugging existing software and implementing new features. Correctly implemented modularity is financially a very important feature in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some more object oriented programming principles worth highlighting here. The PhoneBook is a good example of how the core application logic can (and should) be separated from both the user interface and any data storage facilities. This is important for a couple of different reasons. First, this separation makes it possible to test the code in smaller units, one class and method at a time. Second, as the core logic is now independent of the interfaces to the outside world, it is possible to change, to an extent, the implementation of either the core logic or the interfaces, without breaking the entire application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file handling process in the PhoneBook application proceeds as follows: the program reads the file just once, as it starts up. After this all data is stored in variables in the program. When the program exits, it again stores all data, in practice overwriting the file. In most cases this is the recommended way to deal with external files, as editing the data in situ is often much more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good guidebooks for learning about good programming practices. One such is Clean Code by Robert Martin. The code examples in the book are implemented in Java, however, so working through the examples can be quite cumbersome at this point in your programming career, although the book itself is much recommended by the course staff. The themes of easily maintained, expandable, good quality code will be further explored on the courses Software Development Methods and Software Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code according to established object oriented programming principles comes at a price. You will likely end up writing more code than you would, were you to write your implementation in one continuous bout of spaghetti code. One of the key skills of a porgrammer is to decide the best approach for each situation. Sometimes it is necessary to just hack something together quickly for immediate use. On the other hand, if in the foreseeable future it can be expected that the code will be reused, maintained or futher developed, either by you or, more critically, by someone else entirely, the readability and logical modularity of the program code become essential. More often than not, if it is worth doing, it is worth doing well, even in the very early stages of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish off this part of the material you will implement one more larger application."
