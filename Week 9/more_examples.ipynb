    "# Default values of parameters\n",
    "In Python programming you can generally set a default value for any parameter. Default values can be used in both functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a parameter has a default value, you do not have to include a value as an argument when calling the function. If an argument is given, the default value is ignored. If not, the default value is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default values are often used in constructors. If it can be expected that not all information is available when an object is created, it is better to include a default value in the definition of the constructor method than to force the client to take care of the issue. This makes using the class easier from the client's point of view, but it also ensures the integrity of the object. For instance, with a set default value we can be sure that an \"empty\" value is always the same, unless the client specifically wants to supply something different. If a default value is not set, it is up to the client to provide an \"empty\" value. This could be, for example, an empty string \"\", the special empty object None, or the string \"not set\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at yet another class representing a student. When creating a new Student object the client must provide a name and a student number. The student number is private and should not be changed later. Additionally, a Student object has attributes for study credits and notes, which have default values set in the constructor. New values can be passed as arguments to the constructor, but they can also be left out so that the default values are used instead. Please have a look at the comments in the code to better understand what each method does.\n"
