No Python attribute is truly private, and this is intentional on the part of the creators of Python. On the other hand, a Python programmer is generally expected to respect the visibility guidelines set in classes, and it takes a special effort to get around these. In other object oriented programming languages, such as Java, private variables are often truly hidden, and it is best if you think of private Python variables as such as well.\n",
