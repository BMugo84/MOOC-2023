    "## Python scope and namespace\n",
    "We already came across the term scope in part 6 of this material, and defined it as the sections of a program where a (variable) name is visible. Looking at the term from another direction, it also refers to what is visible from a specific point in program code. Another related term is namespace, which refers to the names specifically available within a defined Python unit, such as a class or a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope within a method is different from the scope within a class, which is again different from the scope at the client code which creates an instance of the class. A method has access to its local variables, but also to the attributes and other methods in the class it is a part of, even if they are private. The class also has access to these, its own members, but it cannot directly access the local variables within its methods. The client code has access to only the public methods and attributes defined in the class, but of course also some other names in the environment in which it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem counter-intuitive that a class would not have access to all its contents, but it is essential for ensuring integrity. For example, it might make sense to use the same local variable name in various different methods within the same class, if they perform somehow similar functionalities. If the class had direct access to all of the local variables within the methods, they would have to be named differently, or else it would not be clear which version of the variable was meant where. We have already seen with attributes declared with self that helper variables should not be made accessible outside a method, so adding the variables as attributes or global variables should not be an option. There has to be a way to keep names in different parts of the program separate, and this is what namespaces are for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a namespace helps with understanding how the same name can happily coexist in different functions, classes or modules at the same time. If a name is specific to a namespace, such as a method definition, it is not directly accessible outside it, and so there is no reason why another namespace could not use the same name. Mastering namespaces and scopes is essential in becoming a proficient programmer, and you will get much practice on this course.\n",

    "## Do I need a private method?\n",
    "In the following example the class DeckOfCards is a model for a deck of 52 cards. It contains the helper method __reset_deck, which creates a new shuffled deck of cards. The private method is at the moment only called in the constructor method, so the implementation could arguably be placed directly in the constructor. However, using a separate method makes the code easier to read and also makes it possible to access the functionality later in other methods if necessary.\n"
