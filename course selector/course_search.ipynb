    "So, today i was faced with a challenge. my sister , who is preparing to go to university was sent to a pdf file with the list of courses to apply to with the respective cluster points and university associated with. first look at the pdf file and it was too cluttered, the texts were small, the rows were long and the columns many.It couldnt be opened on a simple smartphone pdf reader or laptop as one would have to keep scrolling on and onup and down, left and right. its tiresome.\n",
    "\n",
    "i was able to open it with excel and filter out down to the university she wanted but i had to convert the pdf into an excel spreadsheet and then filter the courses. so i thought, whatif i could just write a python code to do all that for me, make a bot and let it do the work for me?"

    "so basically, the structure of the pdf is like this, the whole courses are divided into major course branches eg bsc, bed, btech, barts etc. then the courses lie under each branch eg bed arts, bed science, bed humanities. these courses are stored in rows and columns whereby the columns are programme code, institution name, programme name, 2015 cuttoff, 2016 cuttoff, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 cuttoff"

Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the execution flow.\n",

    "When a function or method is defined with the `async` keyword, it becomes an asynchronous function. This means that the function can be paused and resumed during its execution to allow other tasks to run. Asynchronous functions are typically used when performing I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file operations, that may take some time to complete.\n",

    "To execute an asynchronous function, you need to use the `await` keyword. When an await statement is encountered within an asynchronous function, it pauses the execution of that function until the awaited task is completed. While waiting for the task to complete, the execution is returned to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run."

    "The ConversationHandler requires us to add two additional components: states, entry points, and fallbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`States`: States represent the different stages or steps in the conversation. We define and assign unique state names to each step, such as \"START\", \"CHOOSING_UNIVERSITY\", \"CHOOSING_COURSE\", and so on. These states help keep track of the user's progress in the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`entry_points` and `Fallbacks`: Entry points define the starting points of the conversation, typically triggered by a specific command or user action. Fallbacks, on the other hand, handle unexpected or invalid inputs from users and provide appropriate responses or instructions. These entry points and fallbacks ensure that the conversation flows smoothly and handles various scenarios."
