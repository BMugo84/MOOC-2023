    "So, today i was faced with a challenge. my sister , who is preparing to go to university was sent to a pdf file with the list of courses to apply to with the respective cluster points and university associated with. first look at the pdf file and it was too cluttered, the texts were small, the rows were long and the columns many.It couldnt be opened on a simple smartphone pdf reader or laptop as one would have to keep scrolling on and onup and down, left and right. its tiresome.\n",
    "\n",
    "i was able to open it with excel and filter out down to the university she wanted but i had to convert the pdf into an excel spreadsheet and then filter the courses. so i thought, whatif i could just write a python code to do all that for me, make a bot and let it do the work for me?"

    "so basically, the structure of the pdf is like this, the whole courses are divided into major course branches eg bsc, bed, btech, barts etc. then the courses lie under each branch eg bed arts, bed science, bed humanities. these courses are stored in rows and columns whereby the columns are programme code, institution name, programme name, 2015 cuttoff, 2016 cuttoff, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 cuttoff"
